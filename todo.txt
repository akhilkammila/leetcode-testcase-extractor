to-do:
    check how many lines by looking for the text 1 and 2 and so on
    fix printing traceback when erroring
    move screenshot on error to the DebugWrapper

    start to fix the solve problem part(load_problem is currently erroring)

to-dos to make this problem run smoother + to help generalise:
    check that switch to python worked by looking for words, not lines changed
    create a default answer based on output type (if output is int, need a certain default #)
    dont add default if the problem was already started (logic to continue previous attempts)
    check fully loading after switch to python by looking for words, not counting lines

to dos to generalize:
handle string inputs
store the testcase info in a file 
automatically create problem solvers based on main page parsing
