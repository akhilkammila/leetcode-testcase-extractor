to-do:
    clean up code
        add locators where there are not
        check fully loading after switching to python in a different way than counting lines (unreliable)
    default answer based on output type (cant always do if False: return)

big to-dos:
    parse different types of inputs, to deal with things like excessively large inputs
        - create hash functions for large inputs
        - make sure that copy paste for large inputs is happening properly
        - make sure this code is clean (subclasses for different testcase parsing), and a large element subclass that also has the hashing functionality
    automatically solve problems based on main page parsing
    deploy to aws

workarounds to character limit (100,000):
    call api within leetcode
    huffman encoding (0.5 ratio)
