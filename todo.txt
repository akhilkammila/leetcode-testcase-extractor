PRIORITY: handle large inputs, where leetcode does not show the entire testcase

to-dos to make this problem run smoother + to help generalise:
reset the code before starting OR
have some logic to continue previous attempts
check fully loading after switch to python by looking for words, not counting lines
handle runtime exceptions and network errors

to dos to generalize:
handle string inputs
store the testcase info in a file 
automatically create problem solvers based on main page parsing
