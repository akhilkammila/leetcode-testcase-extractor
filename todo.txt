to-do:
    run on problems 1-50, and see how far we get
    potentially make a program to look for feasible problem s


big to-dos:
    parse different types of inputs, to deal with things like excessively large inputs
        - create hash functions for large inputs
        - make sure that copy paste for large inputs is happening properly
        - make sure this code is clean (subclasses for different testcase parsing), and a large element subclass that also has the hashing functionality
    automatically solve problems based on main page parsing
    deploy to aws

workarounds to character limit (100,000):
    call api within leetcode
    huffman encoding (0.5 ratio)
